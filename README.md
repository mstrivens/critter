**Domain Modelling**



**Using an ORM**

I decided it would be beneficial to use an Object Relational Mapper. I did this because having working with ActiveRecord in Rails it would make it easier for me to interact with the database.

**Gems**

capybara
rspec
totalCov
rubocop
pg
data_mapper
dm-postgres-adaptor
travisCI
